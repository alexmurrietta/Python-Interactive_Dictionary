# Python-Interactive_Dictionary
A dictionary application. The 1st version pulls data from a data file, while the 2nd version pulls from a mySQL database. Currently only works inside a Python terminal. Working on getting it web-based.

Enter any word and this application will return the definiton. 
It also accounts for mispelled words and will suggest a similar word.

# Python-Interactive_Dictionary
The [1st version](https://github.com/alexmurrietta/Python-Interactive_Dictionary/blob/master/Dictionary-1.py) pulls data from a data file, while the [2nd version](https://github.com/alexmurrietta/Python-Interactive_Dictionary/commit/51defa488ab610cd0463c4177a6a2894cfa5fe2f) pulls from a mySQL database. 

Currently only works inside a Python terminal, but working on getting it web-based.

Enter any word and this application will return the definiton. 
It also accounts for mispelled words and will suggest a similar word.
